Some of my old files created to study

1. regex_telephone_numbers - finds telephone numbers in file using regular expressions
2. map_text_splitter - splits text to words (works with all of the signs and paragraphs) and inserts it to map with frequency of appearance
3. smart_calendar - final project of "basics of IT", calendar mainly created to saving, modifing and delating events but also has many different functions such as showing view of normal calendar, searching by all of the atributes and in time etc. Definetely my best and most time consuming project.
4. lambda expressions and sorting - sorting structs by type using lambda expressions
5. drawing square - function drawing square of chosen size and chosen diagonals (left, right, both or without)
6. random vector - inserting random values to vector and delating chosen item
7. text splitter - puts words from text into vector
8. prime numbers - simple function checking if number is prime
9. binary search - finds chosen value in file using binary search
